### python-api-challenge

### Used youtube and former activities from class to help with assignment. Also used Stackoverflow and pandadocs with 'for loop'. Rewatched some old class recordings as well; specifically week 5 and week 6 recordings.  All were very helpful and I was able to figure out and understand what I was doing.
